# Galleria_VanillaJS
The project is the result of my recent 'advanced' learning of JavaScript.

After spending some time learning JavaScript through numerous sources, I wanted to build a project for myself to know what I've learned.
My biggest problem was being afraid that I would go into too much detail because JS isn't that big deal. 
So I decided to make things that I always wanted: 
1.) Filtering displayed products on the webshop.
2.) That overused section near the footer that displays analytics for users.
and I've made those systems, but it was too simple... 
and as you could anticipate, I've made a whole landing page and added a search bar to find something that you could FILTER.
yup, I also fetched data from Unsplash API and set it up using Axios. I've added a download button if you really like that one photo, so you could set it as your wallpaper bla bla bla...
And yet, there come their majesties *drum noises* 10 COLOR BUTTONS THAT USE THE PARAMETER OF 'COLOR' IN UNSPLASH API AND SHOWS TO USER THE PHOTOS WITH CHOSEN COLOR.
and that's it!
oh sorry, I need to show my recent @keyframes animation skills, so there is a little animation when you hover the download button!

Sincerely,
